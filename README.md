I am using GitHub now to show my portfolio of projects completed through freeCodeCamp.org. The page also acts as a place to host all of my full stack dev work, and building this site has also been one of my coding pieces to present. It is continually developing, changing and preparing me a lot. Please reach out if anything pops up.
