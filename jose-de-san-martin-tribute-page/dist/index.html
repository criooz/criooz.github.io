                Jose San Martin, along with Simon Bolivar are the fathers of South American Independence.
                In the early 19th century, Bolivar rose as the
                hero of the independence movement in Venezuela and Columbia, while San Martin
                was recognized as the champion of the patriotic forces in Argentina and Chile.
                The two men, however, were
                unlike in temperament as well as political outlook. When they disagreed regarding
                the liberation of Peru, therefore, San Martin resigned his command. He could not
                support Boliver because of their political differences, but he was too great
                a patriot to lead his armies into a civil war, rather than a war of liberation.
            </P>

                San Martin was born to an aristocratic family in Argentina, but was sent to Spain
                to complete his education. In 1808 he enrolled in the Spanish army to fight
                Napoleon, and distinguished himself in several battles. During this period,
                Argentina declared its independence
                from Spain, and San Martin became interested in the cause. He requested to be
                relieved of his command and returned to South America in 1812.

                Within a year of his return to Argentina, San Martin led his first campaign
                against the Royalists. In spite of initial
                success he determined that the Royalist strongholds in Lower Peru (now Bolivia)
                could not be taken by assault because of their mountainous surroundings. Peru
                could only be taken from the south so he set about planning a
                military expedition to cross the Andes and liberate Peru's southern neighbor.
                In 1817 San Martin crossed the Andes with 4000 men. They were met by Royalist
                forces over whom they achieved a complete victory. In 1818 Chile declared its independence,
                and San Martin's army swept into Peru. At first, however, he sought to use
                diplomatic means rather than force to achieve his ends, but after much dithering
                began to prepare for a military solution.

                Unfortunately, during this time, all was not well in Argentina. In 1820 the 'Federalist'
                and 'Unitarian' factions broke into civil war. Alarmed by these developments, San Martin
                resigned his command, but his resignation was not accepted. During this period San Martin
                began building up a navy and as part of his plan to liberate Peru and protect patriot
                ports. In 1921 he finally moved to occupy Lima and called a parliament into
                session to decide on a manner of government. San Martin, however, did not favor a republic,
                but promoted, instead, the idea of a constitutional monarchy. This was, in fact, the
                form of governmet that was desired by most of the people, because they feared (with good
                reason), that "democracy" in Latin America would tend to promote civil wars.
            </P>
            <P>
                In 1822 San Martin and Bolivar famously met face to face in Guayaquil to discuss the
                liberation of Peru. After this meeting, San Martin resigned his command. It is not
                unlikely, however, that he had resolved on this
                course of action before hand. He was discouraged by the civil war that had broken out
                in Argentine and frustrated at the unwillingness of the Peruvians
                to solve their political problems by diplomatic means. He likely believed that
                Bolivar had the stomache for a fight that he now lacked. He had attempted to resign his commission
                on previous occasions and been refused. Now at least he had the opportunity of turning the
                fate of South America over to a true patriot.
            </P>
            <P>
                After their meeting, San Martin returned briefly to Argentina. When he realized he could
                not, in good conscience, take either side in the ongoing civil war he went into self-imposed
                exile in France where he remained the rest of his life.
