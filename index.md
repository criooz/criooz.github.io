## Welcome

For the people who don't know who I am….

I am a simple guy looking for the opportunity to make his dreams come true and hope to carry on with you guys together till the end…

I was born in the darkest Peru several years ago – not several but sounded good.

I am an IT Professional with demonstrating Entrepreneurial Spirit. Serious, intuitive, reliable with a multi-cultural background and an international perspective.

Owing to my innate passion, my studies have led me to specialise in computing and electronics. Information Technology is the basis for which I have developed my first skills: Microsoft Technologies.

I always apply my tried and tested skills to the challenges of today's ever-changing markets. A thorough understanding of what works is used to all my projects using the latest software and technologies to achieve my business goals.

There is not a day of my life that passes without sacrifice, commitment, perseverance and the determination to do better.
