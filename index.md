## Welcome

Let's start from where I was born - I was born in the darkest Peru several years ago â€“ not several but sounded good.

I am a Cloud-First Approach Technologist with demonstrating Entrepreneurial Spirit. Serious, intuitive, reliable with a multi-cultural background and an international perspective.

Owing to my innate passion, my studies have led me to specialise in computing and electronics. Information Technology is the basis for which I have developed my first skills: Cloud Technologies.

I always apply my tried and tested skills to the challenges of today's ever-changing markets. A thorough understanding of what works is used to all my projects using the latest software and technologies to achieve my business goals.

There is not a day of my life that passes without sacrifice, commitment, perseverance and the determination to do better.
